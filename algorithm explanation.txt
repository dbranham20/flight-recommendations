The algorithm used for the auto selection of flights by month is 
quite simple, but effective nonetheless.

The algorithm calculates the percentage, from 0 to 1, of successfully completed 
flights based off of the original columns "DEPARTURES_PERFORMED" and 
"DEPARTURES_SCHEDULED." The average of this score is calculated for each month and
is multipled by 50, to represent the fact that it is worth half of the final score calculated.

The second part of the algorithm is made up of the percentage, from 0 to 1, of the available
seats on each plane. This is based off of the original columns "SEATS" and "PASSENGERS." The
average of this score is calculated for each month and is multiplied by -50, because the higher 
the percentage, the less seats available which, in my opinion, should bring the overall month rank down.

These two total scores are added together to make a final "Algorithm Rank" and then sorted by highest
score. I decided to make the final score "out of 20" because the highest score was ~16 and 20 could be
close enough, but far enough away for the "perfect" score.

In the final version of my project, I hope to keep the algorithm score for each month, but since the 
module used to display the info is a "treeview", I hope to allow each month to be expandable to also
show the top 10 recommended flights for that month as well.
